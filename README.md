Our county is a really small county, about 20,000 population and a mostly agriculture, farming and ranching community. And we’re very much one big family ... So, we’re excited that everybody wants to find our goat,” said Alison Savage, president of the Willacy County Livestock Show and Fair. </p><p>Residents, including families, have been scouring cotton and sugar cane fields since the goat escaped from a pen in the county’s rodeo arena near Raymondville on July 15 following a youth rodeo. On Sunday, possible goat tracks were spotted in a cotton field near Lyford, south of Raymondville.</p>\n\n<p>When the goat first went missing, it didn’t have a name. But after a poll on the livestock show’s Facebook page, the goat was named Willy, short for Willacy County, Savage said. While the goat has a name, Savage said officials are not sure if Willy is a boy or a girl.</p><p>The livestock show has been posting regular updates on its <span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/willacy.fairauction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook page</a></span>. The search has also been a boon for the livestock show, as residents and businesses have donated hundreds of dollars to make improvements to the nonprofit’s arena and other facilities.</p><p>“He’s hiding from us somewhere.

We’re going to find him” Savage said.</p>\n                                    </div>\n\n                    \n\n\n                    \n\n\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n                    \n    \n\n\n                </main>\n\n                \n                    \n                \n            </div></article>",
